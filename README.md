# Poetry-Agent-Orchestrator
🤖🎶 AI-powered poetry orchestrator — routes prompts to lyric, narrative, or dramatic agents using Agentic SDK.


 **AI-Powered Multi-Agent Poetry Classifier & Analyzer** using 🔮 Gemini 2.5 Flash + 🧠 Agentic SDK

A smart orchestrator that reads a poem and decides whether it's 🎵 *lyric*, 📖 *narrative*, or 🎭 *dramatic*, then routes it to the perfect AI agent for an expressive response — all in under 50 words!

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📥 **User submits** a poem or writing prompt.
2. 🔍 **Triage Agent** analyzes the tone and structure.
3. 🤝 It **hands off** to one of 3 expert agents:
   - 🎵 **Lyric Agent** → handles emotional & personal poems.
   - 📖 **Narrative Agent** → handles story-driven poetry.
   - 🎭 **Dramatic Agent** → handles theatrical or monologue-style poems.
4. 📝 The selected agent returns a **short poetic response or analysis**.
